Your alarm screams. The kitchen counter is a war zone. But there sits your mixture machine—small, grinning up at you with that cheeky curved lid. No cords. No fuss. Twist, double-tap the glowing button, and the blades sing. Twenty seconds of tornado-action later, breakfast is ready. Drink. Snap the cap. Run.

#### **Project 3 | CLI Tooth Brush**
<!-- Description:  -->
Traditional toothbrushes generate plastic waste and harbor bacteria in damp environments. The CLI system solves this with a modular snap-fit head design and sliding polypropylene case featuring integrated UV-C LED sanitization—eliminating 99.88% of bacterial load when closed. The 18mm extruded housing contains an 800mAh lithium-polymer cell with USB-C charging, while the dual-rail sliding mechanism ensures pocket-portability. Tool-free head replacement extends product lifecycle, reducing environmental footprint without compromising oral hygiene. <br>
