<!-- ## **I have completed many projects** -->

#### **Project 1 | Universal Flush-Driven Aerosol Air Freshener Mechanism**
<!-- Description:  -->
The Universal Flush-Driven Aerosol Air Freshener is a mechanical system designed to automatically dispense air freshener during every toilet flush. The mechanism operates through a flexible shaft connected to the flush lever, activating the aerosol can without the need for electricity, batteries, or electronic components.<br>

#### **Project 2 | Mixture Machine**
<!-- Description: -->
Your alarm screams. The kitchen counter is a war zone. But there sits your mixture machine—small, grinning up at you with that cheeky curved lid. No cords. No fuss. Twist, double-tap the glowing button, and the blades sing. Twenty seconds of tornado-action later, breakfast is ready. Drink. Snap the cap. Run. Pure mechanical magic that fits in your bag and your chaos. <br>

#### **Project 3 | CLI Tooth Brush**
<!-- Description:  -->
Traditional toothbrushes generate plastic waste and harbor bacteria in damp environments. The CLI system solves this with a modular snap-fit head design and sliding polypropylene case featuring integrated UV-C LED sanitization—eliminating 99.88% of bacterial load when closed. The 18mm extruded housing contains an 800mAh lithium-polymer cell with USB-C charging, while the dual-rail sliding mechanism ensures pocket-portability. Tool-free head replacement extends product lifecycle, reducing environmental footprint without compromising oral hygiene. <br>

#### **Project 4 | Mini Projects**
<!-- Description:  -->
<!-- Successfully designed and completed various industrial and mini projects, including centrifugal pumps, heat exchangers, phone casings, and parabolic troughs. Additionally, developed consumer products like mixer machines, toothbrushes, water taps, waste bins, and helmets.<br> -->
One SolidWorks suite spanning industrial pumps, heat exchangers, and solar troughs—scaled down to injection-molded bottle caps and drop-tested phone shells, then bent into flowing continuous tables and spinning Mobius rings. From calculating shell-side pressures to surfacing mathematical infinity, these projects prove that every constraint—whether factory floor, consumer hand, or abstract topology—is just a parameter waiting to be solved.<br>
